# What has **inner** and **summit** got to do with leadership?

---

Innersummit is all about those moments in business life that you have to dig a bit deeper in order to keep on moving forwards. It is the time when you need to continue believing that you can make it through a situation, which is over whelming. It is the leadership qualities expressed by thousands of people who have lead nations, businesses and communities.  
In essence, Innersummit are the highest and lowest points in life that we internally face.

The Oxford dictionary defines summit as:

> Pronunciation: /ˈsʌmɪt/noun the highest point of a hill or mountain the highest attainable level of achievement

Have you ever started a project, climbed a hill or even run a marathon? You will know that there comes a time when the battle in your mind begins to question whether you can keep on going. It is at these times that you find the stamina, resilience and courage to continue. And what a feeling when you complete that challenge. It is the 'highest attainable level of achievement' that you feel, why? Because you made it.  
Similarly, have you ever approached, what seems to be an insurmountable mountain; leading a large team, businesses acquisitions, redundancy, starting up a new business. You will know that the 'inner' turmoil can often feel like that you are not going to make it. Yet Innersummit is about that very moment of decision to carry on, to get back up and to see it through.
